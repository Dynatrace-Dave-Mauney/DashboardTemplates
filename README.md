# DashboardTemplates
Dynatrace Dashboards that are generic enough to use as a starting point with any customer.  
They are not limited to specific entities and work well with Management Zones.

If you would like to view these dashboards, I can give you readonly access to my personal tenant.

The following list will help you identify dashboards by ID:
00000000-dddd-bbbb-ffff-000000000001 TEMPLATE: Overview
00000000-dddd-bbbb-ffff-000000000002 TEMPLATE: Applications
00000000-dddd-bbbb-ffff-000000000003 TEMPLATE: Synthetics
00000000-dddd-bbbb-ffff-000000000004 TEMPLATE: Services
00000000-dddd-bbbb-ffff-000000000005 TEMPLATE: Databases

Notes: 
The Overview dashboard provides drilldowns and may need some adjustments in the markdown tiles for best results.
You might want to modify the owner to your email address or a customer email address.
